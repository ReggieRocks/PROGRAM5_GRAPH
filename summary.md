## Brief Summary 
This program implements Huffman encoding and decoding using a greedy
algorithm.

The program reads an input file, calculates character frequencies,
and builds a Huffman tree using a priority queue. Binary codes are
generated for each character based on the tree structure. The encoded
file can then be decoded back to its original form.

Key features of this program include:
- Greedy construction of a Huffman tree
- Encoding using recursive tree traversal
- Decoding using the same Huffman tree
- Use of a priority queue for efficient node selection

## A hard-copy of the direct output of your program
You can use Unix’s redirecting commands to redirect the output to some text files and print out the files. I will compare this hard copy with the actual outputs of your programs. They have to be consistent.

##  Hard-copy of the source codes
(optional, only when you want me to check and remark your program.)
